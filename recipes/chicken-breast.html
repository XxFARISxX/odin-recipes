    <h3>An easy chicken breast recipe made with few ingredients.</h3>
    <p>I use this as a basic baked chicken recipe when another recipe calls for cooked chicken.</p>
    <p>It works great for everything and is super customizable. Sometimes I use garlic salt or other seasonings, depending on what I'm using it for.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Â¼ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly butter a baking dish.</li>
        <li>Stir together melted butter and salt in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Arrange chicken in the prepared baking dish. Brush butter mixture onto chicken until thoroughly coated, pouring any extra over chicken.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 30 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
